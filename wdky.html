    <div id="review"><p>I had been putting off reading this book, due to personal reason, which is seen through how many times I renewed the book. I learned a lot not only about Crohnâ€™s disease, but also about how to better advocate for myself as someone with a chronic illness. I related to a lot of what was said, and had to pause it at times to digest what was said. After the 40% mark however I read it all the way through. It was a good read and informative.</p></div>
