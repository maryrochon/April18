    <div id="review"><p>This book took me awhile to get into but after I was, I WAS INVESTED. The twist was completely unexpected and I was happily surprised that I had not guessed whodunit as I have done wth previous books. All the times I paused it weâ€™re due to outside factors, like class, if these facts did not come up I likely would have listened to this book from start to finish. Thriller isn't typically the genre I read but since I enjoyed this, you will see that I check out other thriller books. Kubica's writing style also stood out to me and I will be borrowing more of her books.</p></div>
